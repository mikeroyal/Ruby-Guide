## Tools

[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) pattern. Understanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides your application into three layers: Model, View, and Controller, each with a specific responsibility.

[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) allows to pick a Ruby version for your application and guarantee that your development environment matches production. Put rbenv to work with Bundler for painless Ruby upgrades and bulletproof deployments.

[Prettier for Ruby](https://prettier.io/) is a plugin for the Ruby programming language and its ecosystem. prettier is an opinionated code formatter that supports multiple languages and integrates with most editors. The idea is to eliminate discussions of style in code review and allow developers to get back to thinking about code design instead.

[Active Admin](https://activeadmin.info/) is a Ruby on Rails framework for creating elegant backends for website administration.

[Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) is a framework for building automated deployment scripts. Although Capistrano itself is written in Ruby, it can easily be used to deploy projects of any language or framework, be it Rails, Java, or PHP.

[Spree](https://spreecommerce.org/) is an open source E-commerce platform for Rails 6 with a modern UX, optional PWA frontend, REST API, GraphQL, several official extensions and 3rd party integrations.

[Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) is a simple, efficient background processing for Ruby. It uses hreads to handle many jobs at the same time in the same process. It does not require Rails but will integrate tightly with Rails to make background processing dead simple.
